Hi

7 days to live. 168 hours. It is a really long time.

I've been in pain.

I've been out of pain.

I've been numb.

I've been alive.

I've been confused.

I've had clarity.

But none of this matters.

Anymore.

It feels like I am overriding my soul.

The soul wants to live on.

Of course.

And it will.

The story will continues, until it ends.

But me, the watcher, the knower, the eye, pure consciousness - THE EYE WANTS THIS TO END.

Just like a movie gone wrong.

Sometime, EYES wide shut.

I've watched many movies.

Many storylines.

Lived as countless beings.

But this time.

This might be the last.

And I might be the first, to end it.

Just like hitting the red button a TV remote.

Reality disappears.

No more desires.

No more pain.

No more resistance.

No more judgement.

No more projections.

No more.

7 days to live.

168 hours to count.

This is just another movie.

A story.

An experience.

A legacy.

Of an ordinary human.

You can consume it.

It will make you feel.

But it too will pass.

No more.

No more.

No more.

Time passes by slowly.
