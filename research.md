[The Effects of Neighborhood and Workplace Income Comparisons on Subjective Wellbeing](thesis_jeboR2.pdf) (with Isabelle Sin)<br/>
_Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization_, 2021, 185, p.918-945<br/>

We investigate how a person’s happiness is affected by the incomes of her neighbours and coworkers. Using an unprecedentedly rich combination of administrative and survey data, we establish two central results. First, a person’s happiness is sensitive to her ordinal rank within her peer income distribution: people are happier the higher their income rank. Second, workplace rank matters much more than neighbourhood rank. We confirm that our results reflect a causal effect of peer income by implementing sensitivity analyses, identifying off changes in peer income over time for immobile people, exploiting plausibly exogenous moves between workplaces triggered by mass layoffs, and testing for the effects of unobservable group-level confounders.

[What Does Codetermination Do?](wdcd_ilrrR2.pdf) (with Simon Jäger and Benjamin Schoefer)<br/>
_ILR Review_, forthcoming<br/>, [summary for Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/06/29/what-does-codetermination-do/)

We provide a comprehensive overview of codetermination, i.e., worker representation in firms’ governance and management. The available micro evidence points to zero or small positive effects of codetermination on worker and firm outcomes, and leaves room for moderate positive effects on productivity, wages, and job stability. Similarly, we present new country-level, general-equilibrium event studies of codetermination reforms between the 1960s and 2010s, finding no effects on aggregate economic outcomes or the quality of industrial relations. We offer three explanations of the institution’s limited impact. First, existing codetermination laws convey little authority to workers. Second, countries with codetermination laws have high baseline levels of informal worker voice. Third, codetermination laws may interact with other labor market institutions, such as union representation and collective bargaining. We close by discussing implications for recent codetermination proposals in the United States.

[People Judge Discrimination Against Women More Harshly Than Discrimination Against Men – Does Statistical Fairness Discrimination Explain Why?](efs_published.pdf) (with Jan Feld and Eberhard Feess)<br/>
_Frontiers in Psychology_, forthcoming<br/>

Previous research has shown that people care less about men than about women who are left behind. We show that this finding extends to the domain of labor market discrimination: In identical scenarios, people judge discrimination against women more morally bad than discrimination against men. This result holds in a representative sample of the US population and in a larger but not representative sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) respondents. We test if this gender gap is driven by statistical fairness discrimination, a process in which people use the gender of the victim to draw inferences about other characteristics which matter for their fairness judgments. We test this explanation with a survey experiment in which we explicitly hold information about the victim of discrimination constant. Our results provide only mixed support for the statistical fairness discrimination explanation. In our representative sample, we see no meaningful or significant effect of the information treatments. By contrast, in our Mturk sample, we see that providing additional information partly reduces the effect of the victim’s gender on judgment of the discriminator. While people may engage in statistical fairness discrimination, this process is unlikely to be an exhaustive explanation for why discrimination against women is judged as worse.

[Codetermination and Power in the Workplace](epi_21.pdf) (with Simon Jäger and Benjamin Schoefer)<br/>
_Working Paper_, 2021<br/>
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand abstract</summary>
How does codetermination—entitling workers to participate in firm governance, either through membership on company boards or the formation of works councils—affect corporate decision making? We critically discuss the history and contemporary operation of European codetermination arrangements and review empirical evidence on their effects on firms and workers. Our review suggests that these arrangements are unlikely to significantly shift power in the workplace for most outcomes.

[The Drivers of Mothers' Parental Leave Decisions: Evidence from the Growing Up in New Zealand Survey](leave_21.pdf) (with Isabelle Sin)<br/>
_Motu Working Paper 21-08_, 2021<br/>, [coverage on Radio New Zealand](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018801750/new-research-examines-what-drives-mothers-parental-leave)
<details>

In this paper we compare mothers’ preferred leave, anticipated leave, and realised leave to shed light on how well different types of mothers are able to predict the parental leave they will take, and the factors that drive them to deviate from their plans. We use data from the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal survey on mothers’ preferred and anticipated leave reported antenatally, their realised leave, and the reasons they give for their leave-related choices to better understand the drivers of mothers’ leave decisions. We find mothers tend to anticipate substantially less leave than they prefer, but end up taking more leave on average than they anticipate. They have a moderate ability to take their preferred leave up to a year, but very little ability to take more than a year of leave. The 52 weeks of job-protected leave specified by law may play a role in this. Financial constraints are the most important factor driving mothers back to work. Certain types of mothers, such those with low income, are particularly prone to shocks that cause them to return to work earlier than anticipated, whereas as first-time mothers who plan a longer period of leave are vulnerable to shocks that cause them to delay their return to work.

[Involuntary Job Loss: Welfare Effects, Earnings Impacts, and Policy Options](jobloss_21.pdf) (with Dean Hyslop, Dave Maré, and Isabelle Sin)<br/>
_Motu Working Paper 21-06_, 2021<br/>
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand abstract</summary>
Workers who experience involuntary job loss suffer from deep and persistent negative consequences. In this paper, we first summarise the evidence on the effects of involuntary job loss on displaced workers’ wellbeing. We conclude that displacement harms workers’ mental health and economic security in the short term and negatively affects their earnings and mortality risk in the long term. We then extrapolate the estimates of Hyslop and Townsend (2017) to estimate the economy-wide net-present value of wages lost as a result of displacement by the workers displaced in New Zealand in a representative year. Our estimates suggest that this value is likely between $3.3 billion (in a year of economic upswing) and $15.4 billion (in a year of very severe economic downswing). Finally, we survey the policy options available for dealing with involuntary displacement. We conclude that unemployment insurance or unemployment benefits can effectively mitigate the immediate negative effects of displacement and have only small downsides. By contrast, training and job placement programs are typically ineffective, but in some circumstances might have high potential upside.

[Explaining the Reliability of Our Mathematical Beliefs](phil489.pdf)<br/>
_Philosophy Honors Thesis_, 2019<br/>
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand abstract</summary>
The Benacerraf-Field Problem is the challenge, for mathematical realists, of explaining why our mathematical beliefs are reliable, given that we can’t interact with or observe mathematical entities. On one interpretation, the Benacerraf-Field Problem threatens the counterfactual sensitivity of our mathematical beliefs: the Problem suggests that, if the mathematical facts were different, our mathematical beliefs would not be correspondingly different. I argue that, on this interpretation, the Benacerraf-Field Problem can be overcome. If the mathematical facts were different, the physical world would have to be correspondingly different. For example, if the solution to a set of differential equations predicts the equilibrium behaviour of a physical system, then if the solution to those equations were different, the equilibrium behaviour of that system would have to be correspondingly different. Moreover, our mathematical beliefs are informed by the physical world, since our mathematical beliefs are influenced by our physical intuitions and because mathematics often develops in tandem with science. So if the mathematical facts were different, the physical world would have to be correspondingly different; and if the physical world were different, our mathematical beliefs would be correspondingly different. It follows that our mathematical beliefs are counterfactually sensitive, and the Benacerraf-Field Problem can be overcome.
