Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am a recent MBA student set to graduate with a focus on business strategy and digital marketing. I have worked on strategic initiatives and I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to drive growth. This site highlights my resume, key projects and skills.

I hold a Bachelor's degree from United States International Universityâ€“Africa and have completed internships at Umande Trust, Bedrock Holding Ltd. and Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, where I developed a strong foundation in collaborative environments where I gained market analysis and leadership skills. This enabled me to start my own venture, Pink Harlem.

My experience running a business has sharpened skills in project management, strategic planning, and team collaboration.
