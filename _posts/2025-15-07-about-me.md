I’m a versatile technical writer with a strong foundation in creating clear, user-friendly documentation, and a unique background in product marketing. With 10 years of experience, I specialize in translating complex technical concepts into accessible content that speaks to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in fast-paced environments across various industries, developing expertise in creating detailed manuals, user guides, and API documentation. I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate closely with product teams, engineers, and marketing professionals, ensuring that my content is not only accurate but also aligned with broader business goals. My product marketing experience has given me a deep understanding of how to create content that supports product adoption, customer engagement, and brand positioning.

I take pride in my attention to detail, my ability to understand customer needs, and my passion for simplifying complex information. I strive to bridge the gap between technical accuracy and marketing strategy, delivering high-quality content that drives results.

Outside of work, I’m a documentary buff with a love for deep dives into history, culture, and science. I also enjoy long drives—there’s nothing like a good road trip to clear the mind. And when I’m not on the road or immersed in a documentary, you’ll likely find me testing my knowledge with friends in a friendly quiz competition.
