    This is a page dedicated to music I have produced. I only made three songs, and they are fire (if fire is hot trash). I thought it was fun and wish I would have stuck with it but apparently geometry homework was more pressing. I hope you do enjoy!

    Here are all my wallpapers (past and present) for ultrawides, phones, profile pictures, you name it! Feel free to reach out for an original copy or download it straight from this page. I will have them organized/grouped by the wallpaper type, but in no particular order.
