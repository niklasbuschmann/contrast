#### [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics, UC3M](http://economics.uc3m.es/personal/delgado-prieto/)


#### I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics, with a focus on questions related to migration. I am also a pre-doc researcher at the Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE)-CSIC in Barcelona and a short-term consultant at the World Bank. I did my bachelor's and master's degree in Economics at Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia.
