Hi, I'm Shakked! Beginning in fall 2022, I'll be a first-year PhD student in the Economics Department at MIT. I'm interested in labor economics, behavioral economics, and political economy.

I'm originally from New Zealand, where I studied economics, math, and philosophy at Victoria University of Wellington. I then worked as a predoctoral research assistant at [Motu Economic and Public Policy Research](https://www.motu.nz/) and MIT before starting my PhD.

On this website, you can find my [research](http://shakkednoy.com/research/) and my [CV](http://shakkednoy.com/cv.pdf).
